# XML Component [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/elasticio/xml-component.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/elasticio/xml-component)

## Description
iPaaS component to convert between XML and JSON data. 

### Purpose
Allows users to convert XML attachments and strings to and from JSON.
This component has 3 actions allowing users to pass in either generic but well formatted XML/JSON strings or XML attachments 
and produces a generic string or attachment of the other file type. The output then can be mapped and used in other components.

### Requirements and Conversion Behavior
Provided XML document (for `XML to JSON`) should be [well-formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_document) 
in order to be parsed correctly. You will get an error otherwise. 

JSON inputs must be objects with exactly one field as XML documents must be contained in a single 'root' tag. 
[JSON inputs can not have any field names which are not valid as XML tag names:](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp) 
* They must start with a letter or underscore
* They cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)
* They must only contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods

XML attributes on a tag can be read and set by setting an `_attr` sub-object in the JSON.  
The inner-text of an XML element can also be controlled with `#` sub-object.

For example:
```json
{
  "someTag": {
    "_attr": {
      "id": "my id"
    },
    "_": "my inner text"
  }
}
```
is equivalent to
```xml
<someTag id="my id">my inner text</someTag>
```

#### Environment variables 
* `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: *optional* - Controls the maximum size of an attachment to be read or written in MB.

  Defaults to 10 MB where 1 MB = 1024 * 1024 bytes.
* `EIO_REQUIRED_RAM_MB`: *optional* - You can increase memory usage limit for component if you going to work with big files

  Defaults to 256 MB where 1 MB = 1024 * 1024 bytes.

## Actions

### XML to JSON
Takes XML string and converts it to generic JSON object.

**Limitation:**
Value inside xml tags will be converting into string only, e.g.:   

given xml
```xml
<note>
  <date>2015-09-01</date>
  <hour>08:30</hour>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

will be converted into:
```json
{
  "note": {
    "id": "322",
    "to": "Tove",
    "from": "Jani",
    "heading": "Reminder",
    "body": "Don't forget me this weekend!"
  }
}
```

### XML Attachment to JSON
#### Configuration Fields

* **Pattern** - (string, optional): RegEx for filtering files by name provided via old attachment mechanism (outside message body)
* **Upload single file** - (checkbox, optional): Use this option if you want to upload a single file

#### Input Metadata
If `Upload single file` checked, there will be 2 fields:
* **URL** - (string, required): link to file on Internet or platform

If `Upload single file` unchecked:
* **Attachments** - (array, required): Collection of files to upload, each record contains object with two keys:
  * **URL** - (string, required): link to file on Internet or platform

  If you going to use this option with static data, you need to switch to Developer mode
    <details><summary>Sample</summary>
  <p>

  ```json
  {
    "attachments": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/files/file1.xml"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/files/file2.xml"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  </p>
  </details>

#### Output Metadata

Resulting JSON object

### JSON to XML 
Provides an input where a user provides a JSONata expression that should evaluate to an object to convert to JSON. 
See [Requirements & Conversion Behavior](#requirements-and-conversion-behavior) for details on conversion logic.
The following options are supported:
* **Upload XML as file to attachments**: When checked, the resulting XML will be placed directly into an attachment.
The attachment information will be provided in both the message's attachments section as well as `attachmentUrl` and `attachmentSize`
will be populated. The attachment size will be described in bytes.  
When this box is not checked, the resulting XML will be provided in the `xmlString` field.
* **Exclude XML Header/Description**: When checked, no XML header of the form `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>` will be prepended to the XML output.
* **Is the XML file standalone**: When checked, the xml header/description will have a value of `yes` for standalone. Otherwise, the value will be `no`. Has no effect when XML header/description is excluded.

The incoming message should have a single field `input`. When using integrator mode, this appears as the input **JSON to convert** When building mappings in developper mode, one must set the `input` property. E.g.:
```
{
  "input": {
             "someTag": {
               "_attr": {
                 "id": "my id"
               },
               "_": "my inner text"
             }
           }
}
```

## Known limitations
 - All actions involving attachments are not supported on local agents due to current platform limitations.
 - When creating XML files with invalid XML tags, the name of the potentially invalid tag will not be reported.
 - When you try to retrieve sample in `XML Attachment to JSON` action and it's size is more then 500Kb, there will be generated new smaller sample with same structure as original
